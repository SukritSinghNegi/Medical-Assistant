Do not pair your dth with tv remote. If you do, the remote starts malfunctioning for original tv controls and there is no option to revert the settings. I had to factory reset the tv. I would say get it if it's below 10k, but add a little more and get a good processor and ram, it matters too much, I didn't know earlier."
